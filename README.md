Module 5 Challenge
Analysis:
    This treatment trial began with 10 different drugs in attempt to minimize tumor sizes in Mice. This data is shown in the Summary Statistics. Over the course of analyzing all of the data, two drugs stood out above the rest for minimizng tumor sizes the most frequently - Capomulin & Ramicane. This is represented by the Box & Whisker plots. When looking into Capomulin even further we found a test subject - y793 - this subject's tumor volume went down as the timepoint increased. Providing a perfect example as to the success of Capomulin. This information is found in the Line Plot. Another interesting piece of data recovered is that from the final plot, the Capomulin box plot & linear regression line. Here we see that as weight increases in mice, the overall size of the tumor is larger. More research would be necessary to confirm causation over correlation, but certainly is interesting. These formulas could handle datasets for other animal/sickness studies.
